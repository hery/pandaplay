You must have Impact to edit this game, but you can run it locally with the minified js file.

Installation
------------

Copy and paste every file in their respective directory in the Impact root folder.

[Online Demo][1]

###### By the way, game.js.min is not meant to be read. It's only there for the demo to work.
